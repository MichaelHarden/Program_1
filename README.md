# Program 1
UAB Probability-355 Group Project 1

# Goal
In this program we are attemping to estimate the distance that must be travled form city A to city P. Furthermore, we are also calulating the standard deviation over many trips.

We are each writing programs to our own approach of this problem. Then we will compare resultes and combine the best parts of each program to have the most optimized code.
